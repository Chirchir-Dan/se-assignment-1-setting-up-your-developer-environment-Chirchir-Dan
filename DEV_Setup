Setting Up My Development Environment on Windows 11


This document details the step-by-step process I followed to set up my development environment on Windows 11, Softwares I installed, challenge I faced and its solution.

1. Installing Windows 11 Operating System

Downloaded Windows 11 from Microsoft's official download page.
Created a bootable USB drive using Rufus and installed Windows 11 on my system.

2. Installed Visual Studio Code

Steps I Followed:

Downloaded Visual Studio Code from VS Code's official download page.

Ran the installer and followed the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Opened Visual Studio Code after installation to verify its functionality.

3. Installed Dart and Flutter

Downloaded the Dart SDK from Dart's official website.
Extracted the Dart SDK archive to C:\src\dart, my preferred location for development.
Added Dart's bin directory (C:\src\dart\bin) to the system PATH.
Installed Flutter SDK:

Downloaded the Flutter SDK from Flutter's official website.
Extracted the Flutter SDK archive to C:\src\flutter, my preferred location for Flutter development.
Added Flutter's bin directory (C:\src\flutter\bin) to the system PATH.
Set Up Flutter Doctor:

Opened Command Prompt and ran flutter doctor to verify Flutter installation and check for any missing dependencies.
I found that Android SDK could not find adb, I was installing on Windows and running it from Wsl2, so there were some tricky challenges.

4. Integrated ADB with Flutter

Challenge Faced:

After installing Flutter, running flutter doctor reported that ADB (Android Debug Bridge) was not found, despite ADB being installed on my system.
Solution Employed:
Configured ADB Path:
Added the correct path to ADB (C:\Users\MyUsername\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools) to the system's PATH environment variable.
Verified the path configuration by restarting Command Prompt and re-running flutter doctor to ensure ADB integration was successful.

5. Installed Python Programming Language.

Downloaded Python from Python's official website.
Ran the Python installer and ensured Python was added to the system PATH.

Installed Django using pip.
pip install django

6. Configured a Database (MySQL)

Downloaded MySQL Database:
Downloaded MySQL Community Server from MySQL's official website.
Ran the MySQL installer and followed the installation prompts to set up MySQL on my system.


Conclusion
I have successfully set up my development environment on Windows 11, now I have Dart, Flutter, Python, MySQL and Django. I overcame ADB integration challenges, I consulted official documentation where necessary. This document provides a detailed account of the steps I followed, ensuring a robust setup conducive to my software engineering projects.
